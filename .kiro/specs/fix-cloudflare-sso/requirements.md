# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The HeyAgent platform currently has working SSO authentication with Google and GitHub in the local development environment (http://localhost:3000), but fails when deployed to Cloudflare Pages with the error "Server error: There is a problem with the server configuration. Check the server logs for more information." This spec addresses the configuration issues preventing SSO from working in the Cloudflare Pages production environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign in with Google or GitHub on the production Cloudflare Pages deployment, so that I can access my templates and account features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Continue with GitHub" on the production site THEN the GitHub OAuth flow should initiate successfully
2. WHEN a user clicks "Continue with Google" on the production site THEN the Google OAuth flow should initiate successfully
3. WHEN the OAuth flow completes successfully THEN the user should be redirected back to the application and be authenticated
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the user should see a clear error message instead of a generic server error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper environment configuration for Cloudflare Pages, so that NextAuth.js works correctly in the production environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed to Cloudflare Pages THEN the NEXTAUTH_URL should be set to the correct production domain
2. WHEN NextAuth.js initializes THEN it should have access to all required environment variables
3. WHEN OAuth providers are configured THEN they should have the correct redirect URIs for the production domain
4. WHEN the Edge runtime is used THEN NextAuth.js should be compatible with Cloudflare's Edge environment

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper OAuth provider configuration, so that the redirect URIs match the production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring GitHub OAuth App THEN the Authorization callback URL should include the production domain
2. WHEN configuring Google OAuth Client THEN the Authorized redirect URIs should include the production domain
3. WHEN OAuth providers validate redirect URIs THEN they should accept requests from the production domain
4. WHEN multiple environments exist THEN each should have appropriate redirect URI configurations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can diagnose authentication issues in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN they should be logged with sufficient detail for debugging
2. WHEN NextAuth.js encounters configuration issues THEN clear error messages should be provided
3. WHEN OAuth flows fail THEN the specific failure reason should be captured
4. WHEN debugging authentication THEN relevant environment variables should be validated (without exposing secrets)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent authentication behavior across environments, so that the sign-in experience is reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN signing in on localhost THEN the authentication flow should work as expected
2. WHEN signing in on the production domain THEN the authentication flow should work identically to localhost
3. WHEN switching between environments THEN users should not experience different authentication behaviors
4. WHEN authentication state is managed THEN it should persist correctly across page refreshes and navigation
